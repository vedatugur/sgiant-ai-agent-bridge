/**
 * GENERATE A DRAFT MANIFEST FROM A LIVE DOCUMENT.
 *
 * `scanAiTargets` grown up: the same walk, emitting structure instead of a flat
 * id list. It is the fastest way to get a surface described — an admin screen,
 * someone else's site, a page of your own — without writing it by hand.
 *
 * ITS OUTPUT IS A DRAFT AND SAYS SO. That is not modesty, it is the reason this
 * is safe to have at all. The scheme it replaces guessed a control's id from
 * whatever attribute happened to exist, was silently wrong for most controls,
 * and nobody noticed — because nothing ever announced that it was guessing. So:
 *
 *   - every control comes back `mutates: true, inferred: true`
 *   - the manifest is `trust: "generated"`
 *
 * MUTATES DEFAULTS TO TRUE BECAUSE THE GENERATOR CANNOT KNOW. A DOM walk cannot
 * tell "Apply filter" from "Delete everything" — both are buttons with a word
 * on them. Defaulting to false would make the assistant free to click a
 * destructive control the moment somebody ran the generator; defaulting to true
 * makes it ask, which is merely annoying. The overrides file is where a person
 * relaxes it, and a person is who should.
 *
 * Anchors are the exception: an `<a href>` navigates, and navigation is already
 * held by the path allow-list, so it is not the confirm gate's job as well.
